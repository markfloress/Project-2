# Instanews

<p> Instanews is a website that allows the user to check the current news. 
The website grabs the current news using the API from the New York Times and generates it on the site by an Ajax function.

<h2> Learning and Programs </h2>
<ul>
<li> I found that making the markup was very easy. I am very familiar with how the markup works now and confident in my work.</li>
<li> I also found that the CSS for this project was fairly easy. I love using SASS/SCSS, it helped A LOT on keeping my files and codes organized.</li>
<li> The Jquery, Javascript and Ajax was the difficult part for me. I am getting familiar with using it, but I honestly still need to learn and practice it a lot to fully grasp and be efficient in my work.</li>
</ul>

<p> Do note that I took on a stretch goal for the project, which is to hide the article description on the face of the list and viewing it simply by hovering on the article you wanted to read</p>
